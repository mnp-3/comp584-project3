          <p>I really enjoyed reading this. it is my first Elin Hilderbrand book so im not sure how it compares to her other popular novels but i enjoyed this one. there are many povs with many plot lines & some where boring for me so i had trudge through those. i can't wait to see where the series heads to</p>

          <p>it was a good read with lots of dry humor that i enjoyed. i dont think this might be for everyone because of how Cora comes off as and what she does. but it was a good read to see this whole scenario play out </p>

          <p>amazing. I love the way Jessa Hastings writes her novels and i get so immersed in the story. At multiple point i feel sharp bangs in my heart like wtf! the way Hasting finds the perfect words to describe what the characters are feeling is unreal. this definitely reminds me of MPU and i cant wait to see where this story continues! i wish i took my time with it but at the same time i just couldnt put it down. i switched back and forth to the audiobook & i def recommend the audiobook for Joah's parts</p>

          <p>i am unwell. this book was so painful. my heart hurts for both Lizzie & Hugh and everything they have been through. the first half of the book was so graphic and cruel, I was not prepared for. the last 20% of the book i was completely heartbroken. don't appreciate the fact that I have to remain in this heart broken stage for an unknown period of time. i was glad to revisit some of my favorite characters from the universe and reading about them again at least brought me some joy. </p>

          <p>this was so long, i did enjoy the overall plot but it was unnecessarily long. it also ends in a cliffhanger i will continue the series because i'm three books in and im waiting for ONE specific thing so it better be worth it!!! lol</p>

          <p>“If women supported each other the way men do, the world would look very different.” The Book Club for Troublesome Women is a beautiful, moving novel that left a lasting impression on me. Set in the 1960s, it captures the strength and resilience of sisterhood in a way that still resonates today. I’ll absolutely be recommending this to friends, and I urge anyone reading this to give it a chance. It’s inspiring in all the right ways, and I can’t wait to dive into more of Bostwick’s work. It also gave me the same vibe as the show Desperate Housewives, which I absolutely love! So if you're also a fan you'll love this one!</p>

          <p>Please read the trigger warnings before starting this book. I really enjoyed this book, largely because of how layered and complex the characters are. The family dynamics are intense, emotionally complicated and realistic. I was especially impressed by how Jessa Hastings captured Georgia’s raw emotions and used body language analyzing to navigate the events in the book. it was a great read and many quotes have left me inspired and understood in ways I've struggled to articulate myself. Hastings' writing is beautiful and i look forward to whatever she has planned next. ALSO!!!! I did peep that MP Universe easter egg!!!!</p>
